# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

## The challenge

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. 

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, I am asked to build a predictive model to determine how likely a passenger survived the sinking given some passenger data.

This challenge can be found in the [Kaggle Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

### Goal

It's my job to predict whether a passenger survived the sinking or not. For each in the test, I must predict a 0 or 1 value for the variable.

### Data

The data has been split into two files:
* train.csv - contains the data used to train the model
* test.csv - contains the data that will be used to test the model
